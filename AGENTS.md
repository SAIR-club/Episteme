# AI Agent Instructions

This file is the single source of truth for AI coding assistants working on this project. Tool-specific instruction files, such as `CLAUDE.md`, should point here instead of duplicating these rules.

Keep this file limited to durable, cross-session guidance. Current progress, temporary state, and session scratch do not belong here.

## Project

- Purpose: Episteme turns inquiry into persistent, evolving understanding. It is open cognitive infrastructure for carrying, organising and evolving human understanding: one graph that Learn, Forum and Research project views over, rather than separate knowledge stores. The most valuable asset is not chat history or course content but the cognitive graph that keeps evolving. See `README.md`.
- Stack: TypeScript (strict, ESM, NodeNext), pnpm workspace monorepo, Vitest, ESLint (flat config), Prettier. No framework, database or model provider is wired in yet — Core must run and be tested with no frontend, no LLM and no database.
- Package manager: pnpm, pinned by `packageManager` in `package.json` (see `pnpm-workspace.yaml`). The project supports Node >= 20.11 (`engines`). pnpm 11 itself needs Node >= 22.13 to run, so develop on Node 22.13 or later, or use a standalone pnpm. The two floors differ on purpose; see [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration).

## Commands

- Install: `pnpm install`
- Dev: `pnpm demo` (runs the v0 closed loop from `examples/learn-session`)
- Test: `pnpm test` (or `pnpm test:watch`)
- Check: `pnpm check` (typecheck + lint + test). Individually: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`. `pnpm build` emits `dist/` via project references.

Note: Vitest resolves `@episteme/*` through each package's `dist/`, so **run `pnpm typecheck` (or `pnpm build`) before `pnpm test`** after changing a package's source, or tests will run against stale compiled output.

## Communication

- Use Simplified Chinese for user-facing explanations, questions, progress updates, and summaries.
- Keep code, identifiers, comments, logs, test names, and commit messages in English.
- Match the surrounding language when editing existing documentation.

## Working Agreement

- Stay within the stated scope. Do not add, refactor, or improve unrelated functionality.
- Preserve unrelated working-tree changes and never discard user work.
- Follow the project's existing structure, conventions, and patterns.
- Adding, updating, or removing dependencies is allowed and encouraged when it benefits the project. Always propose the change first and wait for the user's explicit approval before applying it.
- If a request is ambiguous, risky, or has materially different approaches, explain the trade-offs and ask before changing files.
- If the safest path is clear and within scope, proceed and state any important assumption.
- Treat a request containing `dry-run` as read-only. Explain what would be done without modifying files or configuration.

## Engineering Principles

- Make the smallest precise change that solves the problem; avoid unrelated refactoring.
- Identify business invariants and express each invariant in one authoritative place.
- Centralize shared validation, configuration, authorization, caching, and API contracts.
- Do not use broad `try/catch` blocks to swallow errors.
- Do not hide failures behind silent fallbacks.
- Prefer readable business flow over fragmented helper methods.
- Do not split a cohesive workflow into many one-use private methods.
- Introduce abstractions only for real reuse, a clear reduction in complexity, or an excessively long method.
- Use the Unix toolchain integrated into the terminal when it is the best fit for the task.

## Tool Routing

- Use CodeGraph for structural code questions: symbol definitions and signatures, callers and callees, execution flow, and change impact.
- Use `rg` for literal text, comments, log messages, and filenames.
- The terminal provides the Unix command set via **uutils-coreutils** (installed through Scoop `main` bucket at `D:\Workspace\Apps\Scoop\apps\uutils-coreutils\current\`). Use Unix commands when they are the best fit for the task. Note: in PowerShell, `ls`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm` etc. are shadowed by aliases to native cmdlets (`Get-ChildItem`, `Get-Content`, ...) — invoke the Unix binaries by full path, or use the PowerShell cmdlets directly.
- Prefer integrated CodeGraph MCP tools. If `.codegraph/` is missing, ask before running `codegraph init -i`.
- Use Sivtr before asking the user to repeat terminal output, prior decisions, validation evidence, debugging history, or earlier agent context.
- Search Sivtr narrowly and expand only the relevant records. Treat retrieved memory as evidence, then verify current files or commands before making claims about current state.
- Use `gh` for all GitHub API and pull-request access (`gh api`, `gh pr`, `gh issue`, ...). `gh` authenticates automatically from the `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` user environment variable; never pass tokens on the command line.
- Authentication lives in exactly one place: the `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` user environment variable. Do not add duplicate auth paths or fallbacks (netrc entries, hardcoded tokens, per-shell wrapper functions).
- Never hit `api.github.com` with raw `curl` or `Invoke-RestMethod`: unauthenticated calls share a low anonymous rate limit and fail with HTTP 403. Route through `gh api` instead.

## Verification

- Run the relevant project checks after making changes.
- Fix failures caused by the current change, then rerun the checks.
- If a relevant check cannot be run, state the reason explicitly.
- Review the final diff and ensure it contains only task-related changes.

## Git Workflow

- Inspect the working tree before creating a commit. Never include unrelated or unrecognized dirty files.
- Create commits only when the user explicitly asks. Committing, pushing, or opening a pull request is never part of finishing a task: "done" means files changed, checks run, and the diff summarized, with the working tree left uncommitted. Group each commit around one coherent change.
- Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits (full format in the [Conventional Commits](#conventional-commits) section).
- Do not push unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Never delete remote branches, including merged feature branches.
- Never force-push or rewrite shared branch history.

### Per-change workflow

- Before any set of edits goes into commits, cut a working branch from `main` (`git checkout -b <type>/<short-topic>`). Commit directly on `main` only when the change is a one-off fix that will not become a PR.
- Split the work into one commit per coherent unit (feature / refactor / docs / chore), never one big mixed commit, and never commit unrelated changes together.
- Group related units that belong to the same module or feature area into one branch. When the user explicitly asks, open one draft PR per branch. A PR's title is a Conventional Commit and becomes the squash subject on merge.

## Conventional Commits

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```text
<type>[scope][!]: <short summary>

[body]

[footer(s)]
```

- **type** — lowercase: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`, `revert`.
- **scope** (optional) — affected area in parentheses, e.g. `feat(parser):`.
- **`!`** — breaking change, e.g. `feat!:`. Equivalent: `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer.
- **summary** — imperative, lowercase, ≤ 50 chars: `fix crash on empty input`.
- **footer** (optional) — `BREAKING CHANGE: <desc>`, `Fixes #123`, `Refs #456`.

Example:

```text
feat(api)!: require auth token on all endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: unauthenticated requests are now rejected with 401.
```

Version-bump mapping per type lives in [Version Management](#version-management).

## Pull Request Workflow

- Open or update a pull request only when the user explicitly asks.
- Use a dedicated branch and follow any repository-specific branch naming convention. Do not perform feature work directly on the default branch.
- When one branch depends on another unmerged branch, stack the PRs with `gh stack init <bottom> ... <top>` then `gh stack submit --auto` (draft PRs; `--open` only when the user asks for ready-for-review); each PR's base points at its dependency so diffs stay minimal until the base merges. `gh stack sync` keeps the stack in sync after upstream merges. **Prerequisites:** `gh stack` comes from the `github/gh-stack` extension — install it with `gh extension install github/gh-stack`; `gh` must be authenticated and have push permission on the remote repository; and GitHub Stacked PRs must be enabled for the repository (otherwise `gh stack submit` fails non-interactively with exit code 9). **Fallback:** push all branches, then create the PRs individually with `gh pr create --draft --base <base> --head <branch>` — bottom PR base on `main`, each successive PR base on its direct dependency branch. Omit `--draft` only when the user explicitly asks for ready-for-review PRs.
- Before opening a pull request, inspect the working tree, commits, and complete diff against the intended base branch. Remove unrelated changes from the pull request scope.
- Run the relevant checks before opening the pull request. Open every pull request as a draft and keep it a draft until the user explicitly asks to mark it ready for review — pushing commits or opening a non-draft pull request triggers GitHub's automated AI review, so do not trigger it before the user asks for review.
- Follow the repository's existing pull request template. Do not replace or bypass project-specific requirements.
- Write the pull request title in Conventional Commits style.
- Keep the pull request body factual and concise. Include the purpose, main changes, validation actually performed, related issue when known, and any material risks or follow-up work.
- After review feedback, address comments within scope, rerun affected checks, and summarize the resolution. Do not silently introduce unrelated changes.
- CodeRabbit auto-review behavior follows the repository's `.coderabbit.yaml` configuration (`auto_review.enabled`, `labels`, `base_branches`, `auto_incremental_review`). A fixing commit does not guarantee a re-review — only when `auto_incremental_review` is enabled. If auto-review is paused, use `@coderabbitai resume` to resume; for a manual incremental review, use `@coderabbitai review` (do not treat `resume` as a general replacement for `auto_review.enabled: false`). Reply to each review thread: when a finding is valid, fix it and reply naming the fixing commit; when it is not applicable, reply with the reason — CodeRabbit may push back with specifics, suggest alternatives, or insist, then either fix, open a follow-up issue for valid but out-of-scope work, or hold the position. Resolve every thread before merge.
- Do not merge, enable auto-merge, close, reopen, or change the base branch unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Keep the remote source branch after merge.

## Continuous Integration

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the merge gate. It runs `pnpm check` and `pnpm format:check` on the `engines` floor and on the current Node LTS.
- The matrix tests the project's runtime, not the toolchain's. Install pnpm with `pnpm/action-setup` and `standalone: true`, so pnpm runs on its own bundled runtime whatever Node the matrix selects. Without it, pnpm 11 starts on the Node 20 floor and fails before installing anything (`No such built-in module: node:sqlite`).
- Changing `packageManager`, `engines.node` or the matrix is one change, made in one PR: check the new pnpm's own requirement (`npm view pnpm@<version> engines`), and keep the matrix's lowest entry equal to the `engines` floor.
- Keep `fail-fast: false`, so one failing Node version does not cancel the others and hide whether they pass.
- A workflow change lands through a PR like any other change, and merges only after that PR's own CI run is green. A workflow that has never run green has not been tested.
- A red `main` is fixed before anything else merges. Until then every open PR fails for a reason unrelated to its own code.

## Version Management

How this project versions and releases changes. AI agents must follow this when preparing or performing releases.

### Version numbers (SemVer)

- Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` per SemVer. In the `0.x` phase: MINOR carries new user-visible features (it may include breaking changes); PATCH is reserved for backwards-compatible bug fixes and hotfixes; MAJOR stays unused until the API/config surface is stable enough to commit to `1.0.0`.
- Pre-release suffixes (`-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, `-rc.N`) mark unstable builds. Keep them few and converge quickly; do not let a release candidate drag on.

### Release cadence

Single track: the release tooling opens a Release PR whenever a versionable commit (`feat`/`fix`) lands on `main`, and later `feat`/`fix` accumulate in that same PR without bumping the version again. Merging the Release PR is the release; cadence is a merge-timing decision, not a configuration one:

- **PATCH (fix) — ship promptly.** When the open Release PR only contains `fix:` commits (version bumps to `0.x.y`), merge it soon after CI passes so hotfixes land without waiting on features.
- **MINOR (feat) — batch.** When the open Release PR contains `feat:` / `feat!` commits (version bumps to `0.x.0`), hold it until enough features have piled up (rule of thumb: 3+ `feat` commits, or 2+ weeks since the last MINOR), then merge. Do not batch so long that hotfix PATCH releases pile up inside one MINOR (see Common traps).
- Either way, re-run the release workflow (`workflow_dispatch`) to refresh the Release PR if the push event missed it.

### Branch discipline

- One branch per task; merge back to main within 2–3 days. No long-lived parallel branches.
- Branch naming: `<type>/<short-topic>` (e.g. `feat/search-index-cache`, `fix/daemon-start`), lowercased with dashes. Do not use a user's name, dates, or arbitrary numbers.
- Delete branches and prune worktrees immediately after merging. Never leave worktree checkouts behind.
- main must always be releasable; green CI is the merge gate. Nothing is pushed directly to main, including CI and documentation changes: every change lands through a PR whose CI is green.

### Commits and changelog

- Conventional Commits (see [Conventional Commits](#conventional-commits) for the full syntax) drive version bumps: `feat:` → MINOR; `fix:` → PATCH; `feat!:` (breaking change) → still MINOR in 0.x, but flag it in the changelog; `chore`/`docs`/`ci`/`refactor`/`test`/`perf`/`build` → no release.
- Record every user-visible change in the changelog. Derive entries from `git log --oneline <last-tag>..HEAD` rather than from memory.

### Common traps

- Hoarding changes into one big release → release per feature batch instead.
- PATCH creep (many patches within one MINOR) → it is time for a new MINOR; PATCH is for hotfixes.
- Branch pile-up (unmerged branches, abandoned worktrees) → merge and clean up.
- Hotfix not merged back into main → the bug returns in the next release.
- Version mismatch between tag and manifests → the release pipeline fails; bump all manifests together.
- CI pushed straight to main → main goes red unnoticed, and every open PR fails for a reason unrelated to its code; workflow changes go through a PR and merge green.
- Toolchain run on the runtime under test → the job fails before testing anything; pnpm runs standalone, and the matrix only selects the Node the project runs on.

## Project Invariants

These are the constraints the project is built around. Changing one is an architecture decision requiring an ADR in `docs/decisions/`, not an implementation detail.

- **Core only does what the graph itself must do.** Recommendation, voting, hot-ranking, course generation, quizzes, reputation, leaderboards, moderation, agent workflows, UI state and teaching strategy belong to a Domain Extension or an Application. Before adding a feature ask, in order: graph primitive → Core; cross-application domain rule → Domain Extension; otherwise → Application.
- **Vocabulary must be registered before use.** Node types, edge types, state dimensions and tag namespaces go through their registries. Business code must never invent a type string — an unregistered type is invisible to validation, projection and every migration. Re-registering an existing id is an error, never an overwrite; use `registerIfAbsent` to share a vocabulary between packs.
- **History is append-only and is the source of truth.** A `StateEvent` is never edited or deleted. Current state is always `reduce(events)` (`foldEvents`). A change of mind is a new event; a change of direction is a new branch (`fork`). Removal is a `revoke`, not a delete; physical deletion is reserved for privacy and legal compliance.
- **Understanding is not a scalar.** State is multi-dimensional (`exposure`, `confidence`, `evidence`, `articulation`, `transfer`, `conflict`, `source`), each axis declared by a registered dimension definition. Never introduce a single `mastery` score.
- **State belongs to the actor, not the node.** A `StateEvent.actorId` is a separate axis from a node's authorship: an agent may author a node while a human's understanding of it changes. Two actors must never share state.
- **AI is a cognitive scaffold, not the author of the user's thinking.** An agent may suggest structure, connections and state changes. Everything it infers is `suggested` and requires human confirmation before it becomes the user's state. No agent may write to the graph directly or decide which side of a conflict is right.
- **Conflict is preserved, not resolved.** Contradicting claims are kept with their authors, sources, evidence, times and states. Never let a model silently pick a winner.
- **Draft → Thought → Reference.** Raw AI transcripts, temporary notes and generated content are drafts and stay out of the graph until a human organises them. A `thought` must carry a source and at least one anchor. A `reference` is public, sourced and verified — not absolute truth.
- **Private by default, contributed deliberately.** Personal state events and claims are private; concepts and references are public or controlled. Contribution is an explicit opt-in.
- **Every mutation goes through one validation path.** `validateMutation` runs structural checks and then registered guards. Adapters store entities and must not enforce rules of their own — a second authority would diverge. Refusals are first-class values (`previewNode`/`previewEdge` return a `MutationRefusal`) so a suggestion can be shown and dismissed without exception control flow.
- **Core invents no identity and reads no wall clock.** Time comes from a `Clock`, ids from an `IdFactory` or from the caller-supplied draft, so histories are replayable and output is byte-stable. Ids are branded; `asId` is the only sanctioned cast.
- **One graph, many views.** Learn, Forum and Research differ by projection rule (scope, actor, topic, state, depth), never by data model. Never create a second graph for a new scene.

## Durable Handoff

- Record durable architecture, contracts, workflows, known limitations, and recurring gotchas in the appropriate project documentation.
- Do not turn durable documentation into a session journal.
- Keep any documentation touched during the task accurate within its scope.

## Done

- Relevant checks pass, or any unrun checks are explained.
- The diff contains only task-related changes.
- The completion summary states what changed, key decisions, verification performed, and any remaining risks.
